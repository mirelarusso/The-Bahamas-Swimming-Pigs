                <p>If you're staying in Nassau or The Exumas, you can easily book a day trip to see the swimming pigs.</p>
                <p>Wherever they came from, there are now about 20 pigs and piglets on Pig Beach. With daily visits from Bahamians and tourists, the pigs are living the easy life on Big Major Cay.</p>

                <h3>Anecdotal history</h3>
                <p>The pigs are said to have been dropped off on Big Major Cay by a group of sailors who wanted to come back and cook them. The sailors, though, never returned; the pigs survived on excess food dumped from passing ships. One other legend has it that the pigs were survivors of a shipwreck and managed to swim to shore, while another claims that the pigs had escaped from a nearby islet. Others suggest that the pigs were part of a business scheme to attract tourists to the Bahamas. The pigs are now fed by locals and tourists and the island is unofficially known as Pig Beach by the locals.</p>

                    <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                    <p>Since the island is uninhabited, that also means there’s no airstrip for planes to land, and that you need to take a boat to get to it. Staniel Cay is the closest island with an airport, and you can either rent or hire a boat from there to get to Pig Beach.</p>
                    <p>There is also a very small island/cay in Abacos near Green Turtle Cay that has a smaller population of pigs, although they didn’t really seem too excited to swim when somebody go there.</p>
